        <h4>The culture of Birmingham is characterized by a deep-seated tradition of individualism and experimentation, and the unusually fragmented but innovative culture that results has been widely remarked upon by commentators.</h4>
        <h4>Locals observe a variety of interesting traditions and rituals, some of which may appear rather unique to visitors, while others may merely confuse them. Locals, for example, employ their own system of weights and measures, which is contrary to all international norms. Visitors to any bar will very definitely be served a pint of beer rather than the standard "half of a liter." This is far from the only element that characterizes the indigenous people's culinary traditions. Their breakfast is likewise much different from what people in other nations think of when they say "meal".</h4>
